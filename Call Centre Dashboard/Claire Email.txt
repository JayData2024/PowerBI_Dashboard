Dear Data Analyst,

May I introduce myself? I'm Claire, Call Centre Manager here at ConectNow. My colleague suggested I reach out to you. Pleased to meet you.

I'm looking for transparency and insight into the data we have here at the Call Centre. For example: total number of calls answered and abandoned, speed of answer, length of calls, overall customer satisfaction, etc. What I'm after is an accurate overview of long-term trends in customer and agent behaviour.

I was told you are great at visualising data in such a way that important aspects become very clear. That's precisely what I need. Could you please prepare a dashboard on Call Centre trends that I can use as a basis for discussion with management?

I'll provide you with the required data, of course.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,
Claire
